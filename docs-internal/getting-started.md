### Guidelines
1. Anything that meant to be visible only for the developers should be under docs-internal
(e.g. technologies, investigations etc.).
2. Anything that is relevant to users too or meant to be exposed to the public should be under docs 
(we will probably build pages from these later on).
3. Please always provide tests and documentation for every new functionality to keep the coverage on the maximum.
4. For docs please use markdown (.md) files and language since these can easily be rendered later.
5. Fork workflow is used so under no circumstances should a branch created on the main repository.
6. Pull requests must be approved by at least one person and the CI jobs have to pass before merging.
