## Overview
We want to develop a cross-platform application (mobile and desktop).  
The desktop version would be a well-functioning web application.  
The purpose of the application would be to collect data from several places.  
These places include restaurants, pubs and other entertainment facilities.  
We would mostly collect prices, menus and location. 
Using these we could give our users an approximate on how much they would pay for the provided
amount of people and what they could have for that price.
This is not limited to restaurants of course. An example would be a cinema for 2 people:
tickets cost £10, an average amount of food costs £5, so for £15 they could go to the cinema for 
a date.

Another example would be that someone wants to have dinner in a nice place 
but only has £15 for it. We would list the alternatives for them and the possibilities they
could have for that price.

Also a "randomiser" will be implemented in the app to help people who are bad at making 
decisions.

Additional features might include route planning too. For example after a restaurant they 
would like to have a pint somewhere close. We could plan a route for them to a nearby pub
that still remains inside their budget.

Another feature could be finding partners for the going out too but that might be discarded later.

Owners will also have the chance to upload their own menu/pictures so we can
provide even more precise information about their beloved place and promote it.  

## Purpose
We want our users to:
1. Save money by staying in their budget.
2. Finding new places which they would probably never have visited without Placeholder.
3. Getting valid and up-to-date information about the place they are about to visit.
4. Saving time by not having to search over and over again amongst the restaurants.
5. Couples will never have to argue again about where to eat.
6. Meeting new people.
7. A possibility for the owners to promote their place.
